# Number Guessing Game 🎯

A simple Python-based number guessing game created for learning Git and GitHub workflows.

## About This Project

This repository was created as a practice project for learning GitHub fundamentals, including repository initialization, commits, and push operations. The game itself is a fun, interactive command-line application where players try to guess a randomly generated number.

## How to Play

The game will think of a random number between 1 and 100, and your goal is to guess it in as few attempts as possible. After each guess, you'll receive hints to help you narrow down the correct number.

## Features

- Random number generation between 1 and 100
- Input validation to ensure valid guesses
- Helpful hints (too high/too low) after each guess
- Attempt counter to track your performance
- Clean, user-friendly interface with emoji indicators
